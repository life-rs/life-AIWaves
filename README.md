## Info
The mod does the following:
- loads files from locations folder into waves

wave file structure (name of file is not important)

```
{
	"TimeFromMatchStart": {
		"minimum": 0,
		"maximum": 1
	},
	"SpawnedAmount": {
		"minimum": 0,
		"maximum": 1
	},
	"SpawnPoints": "",
	"BotSide": "Savage",
	"BotPreset": "normal",
	"WildSpawnType": "assault",
	"isPlayers": true
}
```
also supports adding waves in bulks so make sure to structure it as this example below
```
[
	{ "Wave info from above #1" },
	{ "Wave info from above #2" }
]
```
you can get the informations on what to input inside by checking already used waves in db.locations[locationName.json].base you can use mozilla to easly parse that data

* -1 in times means disabled ??

if you gonna make a repack of this mod make sure to change name for it to match your mod thingy :) also any file located in proper folders will be loaded without looking at file name so fee l free to put your names inside ;)
